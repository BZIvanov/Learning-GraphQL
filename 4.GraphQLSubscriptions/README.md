## General info

### Enum

The point of using enum is if we want to enforce specific options only.

For example if we have String! it could be any string and what if we want just a few specific options like let's say: ON, OFF, SLEEP

The other benefit is if we want strings or booleans, if we set string then we will not have the boolean. With enum we can specify some string and boolean values that we want to accept for example
