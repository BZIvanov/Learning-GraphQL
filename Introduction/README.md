# Introduction

## Scalar types

Scalar types in GraphQL are the **basic, primitive data types** that represent a single value. They are the “building blocks” for defining the shape of your data in a schema. Unlike objects or custom types, scalar types cannot have sub-fields — they hold a single value.

**Built-in scalar types:**

- Int
- Float
- String
- Boolean
- ID
