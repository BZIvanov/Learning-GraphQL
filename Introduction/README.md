# Introduction

## GraphQL Playground

**GraphQL Playground** is an interactive, web-based tool for testing and exploring GraphQL APIs. It allows you to write queries and mutations, see real-time responses, explore the schema, and use features like autocompletion and syntax highlighting—all in one convenient interface. It’s great for learning, debugging, and experimenting with your GraphQL server.

### Autocompletion

While writing queries or mutations, you can use **Ctrl + Space** (or Cmd + Space on Mac) to view the list of available fields, types, and arguments. This helps you explore your schema without constantly referring to documentation.

### Schema Updates

GraphQL Playground constantly sends requests to your server to keep the schema updated. You can change these settings if needed by clicking the settings icon.

## Scalar types

Scalar types in GraphQL are the **basic, primitive data types** that represent a single value. They are the “building blocks” for defining the shape of your data in a schema. Unlike objects or custom types, scalar types cannot have sub-fields — they hold a single value.

**Built-in scalar types:**

- Int
- Float
- String
- Boolean
- ID
